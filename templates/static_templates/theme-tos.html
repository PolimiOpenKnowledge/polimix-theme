  <p id="privacy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>Polimi considers the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. Polimi will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personally Identifiable Information private and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless Polimi has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. Polimi takes reasonable measures to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from disclosure to or access by third parties. Please note that Polimi does not guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted.</p>
  <p><strong>What Information this Privacy Policy Covers</strong></p>
  <p>Some of our Site's functionality can be used without revealing any personal information; however, for features or services related to an online course registration and participation, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Site, then the only information Polimi collects will be "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed.</p>
  <p>In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Polimi. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary means by which we communicate with you.</p>
  <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the Site and does not apply to information that we may collect from you through other means such as by mail or over the phone.</p>
  <p><strong>What You Consent to by Using Our Site</strong></p>
  <p>Please understand that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you consent and agree that Polimi may collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable Information, Polimi may not be able to provide you with the services and courses that can be offered on our Site.</p>
  <p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
  <p>We gather two types of information about users through the Site:</p>
  <p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>. When users come to our Site, Polimi may track, collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Site. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
  <p>Polimi also uses or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Site links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Site, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user's identification card for the Polimi servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Site and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow Polimi to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Site. Cookies and web beacons are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time Polimi may also use additional methods of collecting data.</p>
  <p>You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser.

If you reject our cookies, many functions and conveniences of this Site may not work properly.</p>

In order to subscribe to services, you may be required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and email address. You may also be asked to provide demographic information such as date of birth, gender and educational and vocational information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Polimi may also receive Personally Identifiable Information when you access or log-in to a third party site, e.g., Facebook, from our Site. This may include the text and/or images of your Personally Identifiable Information available from the third party site. Personally Identifiable Information shall not include any information posted or sent by or to you via any public forum.</p>
