      <h3 id="topic6"><span>How to manage your personal information</span></h3>

      <h4>Access and correct your personal information</h4>
      <p>Much of your Personal Information is available in your POK account. Your name, email address, and other identifiable profile information is editable through the profile settings in your POK account. Your account dashboard lists all current and archived courses in which you have enrolled and includes links to any certificate of accomplishment you may have earned. The dashboard also contains copies of your answers and other participation and performance in courses.
      <p>POK does not track or index every time or every place on the POK Site when or where a learner may volunteer Personal Information, so POK will not be able to help you locate or manage all such instances.</p>
      <p>POK encourages you to use discretion before volunteering Personal Information on the POK Site.</p>
      <p>Note that usernames cannot ever be changed. This is a POK system restriction. Because usernames identify you in courses and elsewhere on the POK Site, POK encourages you to use discretion in choosing your username.</p>

      <h4>Restrict or object to the processing of Personal Information</h4>
      <p>You may object to, or request that POK stops, its use of your Personal Information by contacting
      <a href="mailto:pok@polimi.it">pok@polimi.it</a>. Please note that if you choose to restrict POK’s ability to process Personal Information, and the processing is otherwise required to provide you with the service offered on the POK Site, you may not be able to establish a POK user account or enroll for a course, and POK may not be able to provide you with this service.</p>

      <h4>Delete account and Personal Information</h4>
      <p>To request deletion of your POK account and Personal Information, you should send a request to <a href="mailto:pok@polimi.it">pok@polimi.it</a>. Because deletion on the POK system is a permanent action and cannot be reversed, POK may ask you to complete a process that aims to confirm your authority to manage the POK account affected by your request.
      </p>
      <p>With respect to your POK account, POK will permanently:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>deactivate your POK account,</li>
        <li>remove the active profile,</li>
        <li>retire your username, and</li>
        <li>remove you from POK email lists.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With respect to your Personal Information, POK will permanently delete your POK account profile Personal Information from the POK Site.
      By erasing the Personal Information in your POK account profile, the remaining information about your activity on the POK Site will no longer be associated with you, except as noted below.
      These changes will be applied to data stores that are used for operation of the POK Site.</p>
      <p>Exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deletion will not apply to historical activity logs or archives unless and until these logs and data naturally “age-off” the POK system.</li>
        <li>POK will archive course data (in a manner and to the extent permitted under applicable law) to enhance the service offered. These archives may be used to produce encrypted research data packages.</li>
        <li>POK will retain and use Personal Information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce its agreements, and as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Data retention</h4>
      <p>POK will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services. If you enroll in a course, your Personal Information will be retained for as long as needed to provide you with services.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3 id="topic7"><span>Storage & security</span></h3>
      <p>POK stores information, including Personal Information, on its own servers located at Polimi.
      POK controls its own copy of information collected through the POK Site and has an information security program designed to protect information in its possession or control. This is done through a variety of privacy and security policies, processes, and procedures. POK uses administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that it collects, receives, stores, or transmits. Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, POK cannot guarantee its absolute security. While POK works hard to ensure the integrity and security of its network and systems, POK cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent “hackers” or other unauthorized persons from illegally accessing or obtaining information.</p>
      <p>If POK learns of a security breach involving its copy of your Personal Information, POK may attempt to notify you electronically so that you may take appropriate protective steps. By using the POK Site or providing Personal Information to POK, you agree that POK can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the POK Site. If a security systems breach occurs, POK may post a notice on the POK homepage (www.pok.polimi.it) or elsewhere on the POK Site and may send an email to you at the email address associated with your POK account.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3 id="topic8"><span>Privacy Policy updates</span></h3>
      <p>This privacy policy will be reviewed and updated from time to time. When changes are made, the privacy policy will be labeled as "Revised (date)," indicating that you should review the new terms, which will be effective immediately upon posting on this page, with an updated effective date. By accessing the POK Site after any changes have been made, you accept the modified privacy policy and any changes contained therein. In case you miss the notification referenced above, be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this privacy policy.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
